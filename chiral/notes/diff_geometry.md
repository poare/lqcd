# Differential forms

#### Vectors and covectors
The definitions in this subsection will be independent of a metric on the space. Suppose we have a manifold $M$ with $\dim M = n$
- Let $p\in M$. A **derivation** of $M$ at $p$ is a map $X : C^\infty(M)\rightarrow\mathbb R$ which satisfies the Leibniz rule at $p$:
  $$
    X(fg) = f(p) X(g) + X(f) g(p)
  $$
  The **tangent space** $T_p M$ of $M$ at $p$ is the space of derivations at $p$. The **cotangent space** $T_p^* M$ is the dual space of $T_pM$,
  $$
    T^*_pM = \mathrm{Hom}(T_pM, \mathbb R)
  $$
  - The **tangent bundle** $TM$ is the vector bundle of rank $n$ with base $M$ such that the fiber at each $p\in M$ is $T_p M$. As a set, $T_M = \bigsqcup_{p\in M} T_p M$. 
  - The **cotangent bundle** $T^* M$ is likewise the bundle over $M$ with fibers $T_p^* M$. 

#### Sections and vector fields
An important set of objects we'll need to work with are vector / covector / $k$-covector fields on a manifold. Let's be more precise: 
- A **section** of a fiber bundle $\pi : E\rightarrow M$ is a smooth map $s : M\rightarrow E$ such that $\pi\circ s = id$. 
  - Basically, a $s$ is a map $M\rightarrow E$ which maps each point $p$ in the base into its corresponding fiber, $s(p)\in E_p$ (for $TM$, $E_p = T_p M$), such that $s$ is continuous with respect to the topology of the bundle. 
  - The set of all sections of $E$ is denoted by $\Gamma(E)$
- A **vector field** is a section of the tangent bundle. We'll denote the set of vector fields by $\mathfrak X(M)$, so that:
  $$
    \mathfrak X(M) = \Gamma(TM)
  $$
- Likewise, a **covector field** is a section of the cotangent bundle. We'll denote this with $\Omega^1(M)$, i.e.:
  $$
    \Omega^1(M) = \Gamma(T^* M)
  $$
- We can act a covector field on a vector field. Let $\omega\in \Omega^1(M)$ and $X\in \mathfrak X(M)$. Then note that at every point, $\omega_p(X_p)\in \mathbb R$, since $\omega$ and $X$ are sections on $M$. Therefore when we act $\omega$ on $X$ we get a function, since each point $p\in M$ is assigned a real number $\omega_p(X_p)$, i.e. $$\omega(X)\in C^\infty(M)$$
- Given a function $f\in C^\infty(M)$, we can form a covector field (1-form) $df$ via the map:
  $$
    d : C^\infty(M)\rightarrow\Omega^1(M) \\
    df(X) = X(f)
  $$
  This map $d$ will extend to the exterior derivative on $k$-forms. 

#### $k$-covectors
The last piece we need to define a differential form is the notion of a $k$-covector. We'll construct $k$_covectors for an arbitrary vector space $V$.
- The $k^\mathrm{th}$ alternating product of $V$, $\Lambda^k V$, is defined to be the quotient of the space of $k$-vectors, $V^{\otimes k} := \bigotimes_{i=1}^k V$, by the ideal $I$ generated by $\{x_1\otimes ... \otimes x_k : \exists i\neq j\,\mathrm{s.t.}\, x_i = x_j\}$:
  $$
    \Lambda^k(V) = V^{\otimes k}\,\mathrm{mod}\, I
  $$
  - This definition is a bit abstract, but essentially $\Lambda^k(V)$ is the "best possible" alternating product of $V$. The passage of the $\otimes$ operation to the quotient space is denoted by a wedge product $\wedge$, i.e. if we use $[\cdot]$ to denote an equivalence class mod $I$, then $[x_1 \otimes ...\otimes x_k] = [x_1]\wedge ... \wedge [x_k]$
    - By "best possible", we mean that each alternating map $f : V^{\otimes n}\rightarrow \mathbb R$ factors through $\Lambda^k(V)$. 
- For our intents and purposes, $\Lambda^k(V)$ is spanned by $x_1\wedge ... \wedge x_k$, where $\{x_1, ..., x_k\}$ is linearly independent (because otherwise $x_1\wedge ... \wedge x_k = 0$). Really, **the most important thing to remember** about the wedge product is that it's antisymmetric:
  $$
    x_i\wedge x_j = -x_j\wedge x_i
  $$
- An element $v \in \Lambda^k V$ is called a **$k$-vector**. The dimension of $\Lambda^k (V)$ is $\dim \Lambda^k(V) = {n \choose k}$. 
- The **exterior algebra** of $V$, denoted $\Lambda(V)$, is defined as the graded algebra containing each $\Lambda^k(V)$:
    $$
    \Lambda (V) = \Lambda^* (V) = \bigoplus_{k = 0}^\infty \Lambda^k (V)
    $$
  where $\Lambda^0(V) = V$. $\Lambda(V)$ is a graded algebra and is equipped with a graded anti-derivation $\wedge : \Lambda^k(V)\times \Lambda^\ell(V)\rightarrow\Lambda^{k + \ell}(V)$. 
- Let's apply this to our manifold $M$. The space of **$k$-covectors at $p\in M$**, $\Lambda^k (T_p^* M)$, is just the $k^\mathrm{th}$ alternating product of $T_p^* M$. There are two equivalent definitions:
  1.  A $k$-covector $\omega_p\in \Lambda^k(T_p^* M)$ can be viewed as an alternating map $T_p M\times ... \times T_p M\rightarrow \mathbb R$
  2.  A $k$-covector is a rank $(0, k)$ antisymmetric tensor at $p$ (where recall a tensor of rank $(n, m)$ is a map $(T_p^*M)^n\times (T_p M)^m\rightarrow \mathbb R$
- Finally, we're interested in fiber bundles, so we'll define the **$k^\mathrm{th}$ exterior power of the cotangent bundle** $\Lambda^k T^* M$ to be the vector bundle of rank ${n\choose k}$ with base $M$ and fiber at $p\in M$ given by $\Lambda^k(T_p^* M)$. 

#### Differential forms
Now, we're in a position to define differential forms. 
- A **differential form of rank $k$** on $M$ is a section of the $k^\mathrm{th}$ exterior power of the cotangent bundle. We'll denote the space of $k$-forms by $\Omega^k(M)$, so that:
  $$
    \Omega^k(M) := \Gamma(\Lambda^k T^* M)
  $$
- There are a number of equivalent ways to view a $k$-form $\omega\in\Omega^k(M)$:
    1. As a $k$-covector field $p\mapsto\omega_p$. 
    2. As an alternating function on $\mathfrak X(M)$, $\omega : \mathfrak X(M)\times ... \times \mathfrak X(M)\rightarrow C^\infty(M)$ (note that it maps us into $C^\infty$, not $\mathbb R$, for the same reason that a 1-form $\omega$ is viewed as a map $\mathfrak X(M)\rightarrow C^\infty(M)$)
    3. 
- Note that differential forms / $k$-covectors are linear functionals, as $T_p^* M$ is the space of linear functionals on $T_pM$
- The **wedge product**: The natural operation that differential forms are equipped with is the wedge product $\wedge : \Omega^k(M)\rightarrow\Omega^\ell(M)\rightarrow\Omega^{k + \ell}(M)$, which is defined fiber-wise $(\omega\wedge\tau)_p = \omega_p\wedge\tau_p$
  - This definition of $\wedge$ isn't that useful, so instead we'll usually use a formula for $\wedge$ upon which the differential forms $\omega$ and $\tau$ are viewed as functions on $\mathfrak X(M)$:
  $$
    (\omega\wedge\tau)(X_1, ..., X_{k + \ell}) = \frac{1}{k!\ell!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_{k + \ell}} \omega(X_{\sigma(1)}, ..., X_{\sigma(k)}) \tau(X_{\sigma(k + 1)}, ..., X_{\sigma(k + \ell)})
  $$
  where $S_{k + \ell}$ is the symmetric group on $k + \ell$ letters. We can see that this definition just extends $\omega$ and $\tau$ into a natural antisymmetric function on $k + \ell$ vector fields. 
  - Note that $\wedge$ is *graded anticommutative*, so $\omega\wedge\tau = (-1)^{k\ell}\tau\wedge\omega$. 
    - This implies if $\omega\in \Omega^{2k + 1}(M)$ for some $k$ (i.e. if it is an odd-dimensional form), then $\omega\wedge\omega = 0$. This can break for even-dimensional forms (think of linear combinations of basis 2-forms, i.e. $dx\wedge dy + dz\wedge dt$)
  - On one-forms, the wedge product acts very nicely, and we can directly compute its action. If we have $k$ 1-forms $\omega^1, ..., \omega^k\in \Omega^1(M)$ and $k$ vector fields $X_1, ..., X_k\in\mathfrak X(M)$, we have:
  $$
    (\omega^1\wedge ...\wedge\omega^k)(X_1, ..., X_k) = \det \left( \omega^i(X_j) \right)
  $$
- The **exterior algebra** of $M$ is the graded algebra
  $$
    \Omega^*(M) = \bigoplus_{k = 0}^\infty\Omega^k(M)
  $$
  which has a graded anti-derivation $\wedge : \Omega^k(M)\times\Omega^\ell(M)\rightarrow\Omega^{k + \ell}(M)$. 
- The **exterior derivative**: The exterior derivative is easiest to define with a coordinate chart, but we'll put its formal definition here for completeness. The exterior derivative $d : \Omega^*(M)\rightarrow\Omega^*(M)$ on $M$ is defined to be the *unique* $\mathbb R$-linear map which satisfies:
  1. $d$ is an antiderivation of degree 1. This means that for $\omega\in\Omega^k(M)$, $\tau\in\Omega^\ell(M)$, we have:
    $$ 
    d(\omega\wedge\tau) = d\omega\wedge \tau + (-1)^{k} \omega\wedge d\tau,
    $$
    and "degree 1" means that it maps $\Omega^k(M)$ into $\Omega^{k + 1}(M)$
  2. $d$ is a cochain map, $d^2 = d\circ d = 0$.
  3. On 0-forms $f\in \Omega^0(M) = C^\infty(M)$, $df\in \Omega^1(M)$ satisfies:
    $$
    (df)(X) = X(f)
    $$
  - These properties turn out to completely define $d$, and they'll all be useful. However, we'll certainly use the definition of $d$ in a coordinate chart more, which is given in the next section. 
- Pullbacks: 

#### Coordinates
Let's parameterize this information when we're given a coordinate chart. This should look more familiar, since we typically compute things in coordinates. 
- Let $(U, x^i)$ be a coordinate chart. Recall that for $p\in U$, a basis for the tangent space is $\{\partial_i\}_{i=1}^n := \{\partial_{x^1}, \partial_{x^2}, ..., \partial_{x^n}\}$. A basis for the cotangent space is $\{dx^i\}_{i=1}^n = \{dx^1, ..., dx^n\}$. 
  - Here $x^i$ is considered to be the map $M\rightarrow \mathbb R$ which associates each $p\in M$ with its $i^\mathrm{th}$ coordinate. $d$ is the exterior derivative, which on functions is just the gradient. 
- The space of $k$-covectors at $p\in M$ has dimension ${n\choose k}$, and has a basis:
  $$
    \Lambda^k (T_p^* M) = \mathrm{span}\{ dx^{i_1}\wedge dx^{i_2} \wedge ... \wedge dx^{i_k} : i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k \}
  $$
  where each $dx^{i_j}$ (in this case) is understood to be evaluated at $p$. 
- A frame for the tangent bundle on $U$, $TM|_U$, is $\{\partial_i\}$, and a frame for the cotangent bundle is $\{dx^i\}$
- A frame for the space of $k$-forms is essentially identical to the previous basis of $k$-covectors, just viewed as a section of $\Lambda^k T^* M$ rather than as evaluated at each point:
    $$
    \textnormal{Frame for } \Omega^k(M) = \{ dx^{i_1}\wedge dx^{i_2} \wedge ... \wedge dx^{i_k} : i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k \}
    $$
- Note that this means that $dx^i|_p(\partial_j|_p) = \delta^{ij}$, or if we abuse notation, that $dx^i(\partial_j) = \delta^i_j$, where the LHS is understood as a function on $U$.

# Forms in Riemannian geometry

- A **Riemannian manifold** is a manifold $M$ endowed with a **Riemannian metric** $g : TM\times TM\rightarrow\mathbb R$. The metric must induce an inner product at each $p\in M$, i.e. the bilinear form $\langle X_p, Y_p\rangle = g_p(X_p, Y_p)$ is a valid inner product (symmetric, positive semi-definite, and bilinear)
  - Note we will usually represent $g$ as an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix, where $n = \dim M$. This is 
  - Equivalently, a metric $g$ is a $(0, 2)$ symmetric tensor field $g\in \Gamma(T^*M\otimes T^* M)$. 

#### The volume form

#### Musical isomorphisms

#### Hodge star
Suppose that we have an $n$-manifold $M$. The space $\Omega^k(M)$ of $k$-forms is always isomorphic to the space $\Omega^{n - k}(M)$ of $(n - k)$-forms, as they have the same dimensionality. 
- If $M$ is endowed with a Riemannian metric, then we can explicitly write down this isomorphism, because we can raise and lower indices
- **Action of $\star$ on a $k$-form**: Recall that in this case, we can decompose a $k$-form as:
$$
\omega = \frac{1}{k!} \omega_{\mu_1 ... \mu_k} dx^{\mu_1}\wedge ...\wedge dx^{\mu_k}
$$
Then the Hodge star $\star : \Omega^k(M)\rightarrow \Omega^{n - k}(M)$ acts as:
$$
(\star\omega)_{\mu_1 ... \mu_{n - k}} = \epsilon_{\mu_1 ... \mu_{n - k}}^{\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\mu_{n - k + 1} ... \mu_n} \omega_{\mu_{n - k + 1} ... \mu_n}
$$
- Hodge star: Note that hodge star is used to contract indices with the $\epsilon^{\mu_1 ... \mu_n}$ tensor, i.e. if we have a $k$-form $\omega_{\mu_1 ... \mu_k}\in \Omega^k(M)$, then we can always construct a top-form with $*$ by:
$$
\omega \wedge * \omega = \epsilon^{\mu_1 ... \mu_k \mu_{k + 1} ... \mu_n} 
$$
- Here note that $(*\omega)_{\mu_1 ... \mu_{n - k}} = \epsilon_{}$
