NPR MOMENTUM FRACTION LOGS:
2/12: The current bug is when I cd into mosaic. Make sure all my paths are correct, because for some reason it's having trouble reading files once I've cd'd into mosaic in the shell script.
  - Edit: Fixed this, for some reason you have to use the mosaic reader load_conf
