- 12/30: Job ID 4056, run failed because of some issues with the bash script. 
- 1/9: Job fail because of time limit. Determine how to run on the longer queues.
- 1/21: Everything up and running, code is reformatted to have parameters be input in the bash script. Code still buggy, going to try to debug with the pure gauge quenched QCD.
  - Job 5097: Old code run with quenched gauge field configurations, errors abundant.
  - Playingwithpions job: Phiala's code run on quenched gauge field configurations.
  - Job 5623: Changed parameters on solver to make it identical to Phiala's code. UPDATE: Job failed because of error.
  - Job 5683: Edited code to make sure that the computation code Phiala has works with my framework. If this works, then there's gotta be a bug somewhere in the correlation function computation. If it doesn't work, then we might have bigger issues with the framework.
    - If this doesn't work, then maybe it's the clover solver. Swap out solver with the one that Phiala's code uses in mosaic.
    - Update: This code works, so there's something wrong in the computation of correlation functions.
- 1/22:
  - Job 5740: Adding in shift to see if code works. If it does not, then there must be something in the Fourier Transform factor. Update: It works! So it appears the problem was in the momentum shift.
  - Job 5741: Running this code with the unquenched cl3 data. This output works as well.
- 1/23:
  - Job 5900: Running cl3 pion mass with configurations from 500 to 1000. Should give 50 configuration outputs, and will examine how the error scales in preparation for computing momentum dispersion curves.
  - Job 5901: Running same as 5900 but with multiple momentum sites.
